\section{Introduction}

These are a collection of personal notes on the ODMB, an circuit board used by the CMS CSC detectors.

\section{ODMB Firmware}

\subsection{Overall Structure}

The current ODMB is largely split into two pieces The first is ODMB VME (MBV), which executes slow control such as sending commands to DCFEB or LVMB and changing ODMB settings. The second is ODMB CTRL (MBC), which executes fast control needed during data taking.

\subsection{DCFEB JTAG and INITJAG}

The DCFEB JTAG device (cfebjtag.vhd) is the first device in the ODMB VME interface. This module is used to communicate with (x)(D)CFEBs via JTAG protocol (via the PPIB skew clear cables). The signals connecting to this interface are listed in table \ref{tab:cfebjtaginterface}.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
Port& Description\\ \hline
FASTCLK& 40MHz clock from top level\\ \hline

       &to be 10 MHz/0.625 MHz in incorrect comments\\ \hline

When a STROBE signal is received and there is an appropriate VME command, a LOAD signal is generated, which then generates a BUSY signal. The BUSY signal then causes the global TCK clock to run. It has been observed that sometimes, a `ghost strobe' signal is received, which causes TCK to run with TMS/TDI set to a constant 0. This may result in strange commands being sent to the (x)(D)CFEBs. The appearance of these ghost strobes seem to change with unrelated changes to firmware, indicating a race condition or something similar. 

The TMS signals are generated by loops of sequentially connected D flops. By using FDC(E) and FDP(E) flops, certain sequences of 1's and 0's are achieved in order to control the JTAG state machine. The FD flops from the Latches\_Flipflops package are found not to work on the KCU105 evaluation board and were replaced with the equivalent UNISIM components. Furthermore, the CB4CE and SR16LCE functions from the Latches\_Flipflops package did not defaultly work on the KCU105 evaluation board, and their implementation was slightly tweaked to nest conditions rather than AND'ing them. It is unclear why this changes behavior.

The INITJTAG signal is generated after receiving DONE from the (x)(D)CFEBs. The signal pon\_rst\_reg is initialized to a particular value from PLL\_LOCK when ODMB is reset and after a few clock cycles, pon\_reset becomes '1', which sets done\_current\_state to DONE\_LOW. When the DONE for an (x)(D)CFEB becomes '1', the done\_current\_state is set to DONE\_COUNTING, which generates dcfeb\_done\_pulse. All the dcfeb\_done\_pulse's are OR'd together and converted to a pulse to generate INITJTAG. Perhaps this logic could be moved from the top level to inside of cfebjtag.vhd.

\subsection{Command Module}

The command module (command.vhd) is a helper device in the ODMB VME interface responsible for decoding the signals received from the VME backplane. The signals connecting to this interface are listed in table \ref{tab:commandinterface}.

For more on VME protocol, see \href{http://www.interfacebus.com/Design_Connector_VME.html}{VME Reference}. This device loads AM into AMS when AS is '1'. When DS are both low, AMS is appropriate, and other signals are okay, a strobe is generated.

\subsection{VME Simulation}

The VME simulation is described by the state machine in figure \ref{fig:vmestatemachine}. Although the time-out functionality works in simulation, it works inconsistently on the KCU105 evaluation board.
